## ⭐ How it works

This monitoring system uses [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org), an open-source uptime monitor powered entirely by GitHub Actions, Issues, and Pages:

- **GitHub Actions** runs automated checks
  - Every 5 minutes, a workflow checks if services are up
  - Response time is recorded every 6 hours and committed to git
  - Graphs of response time are generated daily
- **GitHub Issues** tracks incidents
  - An issue is automatically opened if an endpoint is down
  - Issues are locked so only authorized team members can comment
  - Issues are closed automatically when services recover
- **GitHub Pages** hosts the status website
  - Real-time status dashboard
  - Historical uptime and response time data
  - Incident history and reports

### Security & Access Control

This is a **public repository** to enable free GitHub Actions builds. However, access is restricted:

- Only authorized collaborators can modify the repository
- Issues are automatically locked to prevent unauthorized comments
- All changes are tracked via git commit history
- GitHub branch protection rules enforce code review requirements
